      <h3 class="learning">Machine Learning</h3>
      <p class="note">
        Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence where computers
        learn to identify patterns in large datasets, enabling them to make
        predictions and decisions without explicit programming.
      </p>

      <h3 class="learning">Artificial Intelligence</h3>
      <p class="note">
        Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer
        systems that can mimic human intelligence by performing tasks like
        learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.

      <h3 class="learning">Supervised Learning</h3>
      <p class="note">
        Supervised learning is a machine learning technique where algorithms are
        trained using labeled datasets, meaning each data point has a known
        output, allowing the model to learn the relationship between input
        features and desired outputs, enabling it to predict outcomes on new,
        unseen data based on the patterns identified in the training set.
      </p>

      <h3 class="learning">Unsupervised Learning</h3>
      <p class="note">
        Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where algorithms
        analyze unlabeled data to identify patterns and structures within the
        data without any explicit guidance.
      </p>

      <h3 class="learning">Deep Learning</h3>
      <p class="note">
        Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that utilizes artificial
        neural networks with multiple layers to mimic the human brain's ability
        to learn from data.
